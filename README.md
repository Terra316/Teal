# Doki Doki
Don't play this, I'm compiling it into a C++ application 
to be containerized and run in the web. It is, in fact, 
temporary and will not be on repl for longer than it takes 
me to create it. That said, if you want to actually play the
game, I will publish it on the web eventually (or you can 
download it from Steam or the DDLC website, neither of which 
I can link here because of possible violation of website 
ownership copyrights). However, I will understand if someone 
wishes for me not to build this here, and I would willingly 
move it elsewhere, if given any warning. If this is a 
violation, notify me. I read the terms and conditions, but I 
still am not quite sure if this violates anything.
